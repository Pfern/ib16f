<b>Daniel Sobral</b> graduated in Informatics Engineering from Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico (Lisbon, 
Portugal). His interest in Biology led him to join the Gulbenkian PhD programme, and conduct his doctoral 
studies in Bioinformatics at the Université Aix-Marseille (France) with Dr. Patrick Lemaire. During 
his PhD he worked in different aspects of bioinformatics, particularly focusing on gene expression networks 
underlying embryonic development of a model organism, all of this integrated into a community resource. 
Later he became a Developer for the Ensembl Project where he worked mostly in integrating epigenetic data 
from the ENCODE project in Ensembl. In this context he gained significant experience with high throuthput 
sequencing data. In 2012 he moved back to Portugal, where he joined the Bioinformatics Unit at the IGC to 
assist the local research community in handling the sequencing revolution brought about by high throughput 
technologies. Within this role he been collaborating in several projects, ranging from genomics, 
transcriptomics and epigenetics. He has become the Head of the Bioinformatics Unit at IGC since 2014.
